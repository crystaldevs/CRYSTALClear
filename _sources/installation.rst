Installation
============

You can install CRYSTALClear in two different ways: by downloading the source 
code directly from its GitHub repository or by using the pip command from the 
Python Package Index (PyPI). Follow the instructions below to get started.


Installing via Pypi
___________________

The easiest way to install CRYSTALClear is by using pip. This method 
automatically handles all dependencies, ensuring a smooth installation process. 
Open your terminal and run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

       pip install CRYSTALClear

This will download and install the latest stable version of CRYSTALClear 
available on PyPI.


Installing from GitHub Source Code
__________________________________

If you prefer to work with the source code directly or want to contribute to the 
development of CRYSTALClear, you can clone the repository from GitHub and 
install it manually. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the 
CRYSTALClear project, then run:

.. code-block:: bash

        git clone https://github.com/crystaldevs/CRYSTALClear.git

This method is particularly useful if you plan to modify the code or if you want 
to ensure you are using the latest version that might not yet be published on 
PyPI.


Verification
____________

To verify that CRYSTALClear is installed correctly, you can try importing it in 
a Python session:

.. code-block:: bash

        import CRYSTALClear
        print(CRYSTALClear.__version__)


If no errors occur and the version number is printed, you're ready to start 
using CRYSTALClear!
