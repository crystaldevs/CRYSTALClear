Welcome to the CRYSTALClear Documentation!
==========================================

CRYSTALClear is a Python framework developed to help make the analysis of 
solid-state simulations with the CRYSTAL quantum-chemistry code more accessible 
and efficient. Whether you're working in materials science, computational 
chemistry, or condensed matter physics, CRYSTALClear aims to support your 
research by making it easier to extract and visualize data from CRYSTAL output 
files.

This project started as a fork of `"CRYSTALpytools" <cpt_>`_. , building on the 
excellent work already done there. We've expanded its functionality, improved 
the interface, and added more detailed documentation with the goal of making 
life a little easier for the CRYSTAL users.

CRYSTALClear focuses on simplifying the post-processing of your simulations. 
We've put effort into making it both powerful and user-friendly, whether you're 
analyzing electronic structure or exploring mechanical and vibrational properties. 
Here are some of the main features:

#. **User-Friendly Interface**: We’ve tried to keep things simple and intuitive. 
   The interface is designed to minimize the learning curve, with easy-to-use 
   commands and thorough documentation to guide you along the way.
#. **Data Extraction Made Simple**: CRYSTALClear helps you extract and manipulate 
   data directly from CRYSTAL output files, reducing the need for manual parsing.
#. **Electronic Properties**: : You can generate plots for band structures and 
   density of states (DOSS) to better understand the electronic structure of 
   your materials.
#. **Lattice Dynamics**: Analyze phonon dispersion bands and density of states,
   harmonic and anharmonic IR and Raman spectra with advanced plotting tools. 
#. **Elastic Properties**: Calculate and visualize mechanical characteristics 
   like Young's modulus, shear modulus, and more.
#. **QTAIM (Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules)**: Extraction and 
   visualization of TOPOND data has never been easier. 
#. **Electron Transport**: CRYSTALClear includes tools to investigate electron 
   transport properties for studying semiconductors and other promising 
   materials. 

We hope CRYSTALClear integrates smoothly into your workflow and helps you get 
clear, publication-ready plots and data with less hassle. Whether you're 
experienced with CRYSTAL or just getting started, we’re glad you’re here and we 
hope this tool proves helpful in your work.

Feel free to explore the documentation, and don’t hesitate to reach out or 
contribute if you have suggestions or ideas. CRYSTALClear is a growing project, 
and the community’s input is always welcome!
